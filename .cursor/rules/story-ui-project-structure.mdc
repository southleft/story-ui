# Story UI Project Structure

Story UI is a development tool for generating and managing Storybook stories with AI assistance. Here's the key project structure:

## Core Components

- **[story-generator](mdc:story-generator)** - Core story generation utilities and services
- **[mcp-server](mcp:mcp-server)** - MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for AI interactions
- **[cli](mdc:cli)** - Command-line interface for setup and management
- **[templates](mdc:templates)** - Template files for components and stories

## Configuration Files

- **[story-ui.config.ts](mdc:story-ui.config.ts)** - Main configuration file
- **[package.json](mdc:package.json)** - Project dependencies and scripts
- **[tsconfig.json](mdc:tsconfig.json)** - TypeScript configuration

## Test Environment

- **[test-storybooks](mdc:test-storybooks)** - Directory for testing different component libraries
- Each library gets its own subdirectory with independent Storybook setup

## Key Features

- AI-powered story generation for component libraries
- Multi-instance support for different design systems
- Configurable component discovery and blacklisting
- Integration with various design systems (Material-UI, Chakra UI, etc.)
- Branded Storybook customization

## Development Notes

- The project uses TypeScript throughout
- Components are discovered automatically but can be blacklisted
- Stories are generated based on component analysis and AI prompts
- The system supports considerations and custom prompts for better story generation
