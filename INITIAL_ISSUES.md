# Initial GitHub Issues for Story UI Roadmap

This document contains the initial issues to create for the Story UI roadmap. Copy and paste each section into GitHub Issues.

## 🎯 User-Requested Features

### 1. Framework Support: Vue, Angular, Svelte, Web Components

**Title:** `[FEATURE] Multi-framework support: Vue, Angular, Svelte, Web Components`

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `roadmap`, `priority:high`, `theme:framework-support`

**Body:**
```markdown
## 🎯 Problem Description
Currently Story UI only supports React-based component libraries. Many teams use Vue, Angular, Svelte, or Web Components and would benefit from AI-powered story generation for their frameworks.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
Extend Story UI to support:
- **Vue.js** - Support for Vue SFCs and popular libraries (Vuetify, Quasar, PrimeVue)
- **Angular** - Support for Angular components and libraries (Angular Material, PrimeNG)
- **Svelte** - Support for Svelte components and SvelteKit
- **Web Components** - Framework-agnostic web components following standards

## 🎬 Use Cases
1. Vue teams using Vuetify could generate dashboard layouts
2. Angular teams could generate forms with Angular Material
3. Svelte teams could create component showcases
4. Teams using framework-agnostic web components could generate stories for any framework

## 🌍 Expected Impact
- [ ] Individual developers
- [x] Design teams
- [x] Product managers
- [ ] Stakeholders/clients
- [x] Enterprise teams
- [x] Open source community

## 📝 Implementation Considerations
- Each framework has different story formats and syntax
- Component discovery will need framework-specific parsers
- AI prompts may need framework-specific context
- Template generation should respect framework conventions
```

### 2. Story Code Download & Viewing

**Title:** `[FEATURE] Download and view generated story code`

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `roadmap`, `priority:medium`, `theme:developer-experience`

**Body:**
```markdown
## 🎯 Problem Description
Users can generate stories but can't easily view, copy, or download the generated TypeScript/JavaScript code for further customization or integration into their projects.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
Add functionality to:
- **View Raw Code** - Modal or panel showing the complete generated story code
- **Copy to Clipboard** - One-click copy of the story code

## 🎬 Use Cases
1. Developers want to customize generated stories manually
2. Teams need to migrate stories to different repositories
3. Code review process requires examining generated code
4. Integration with external tools or CI/CD pipelines
5. Learning how to write better stories by examining AI output

## 🌍 Expected Impact
- [x] Individual developers
- [x] Design teams
- [ ] Product managers
- [ ] Stakeholders/clients
- [x] Enterprise teams
- [ ] Open source community

## 📝 Implementation Considerations
- Need clean, formatted code output
- Support for different export formats
- Batch operations for multiple stories
- Integration with existing Story UI panel
```

### 3. Story Sharing Links

**Title:** `[FEATURE] Share stories via public links for stakeholder review`

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `roadmap`, `priority:high`, `theme:collaboration`

**Body:**
```markdown
## 🎯 Problem Description
When Story UI is deployed to production servers, stakeholders and non-technical team members can't easily view and review generated stories without access to the development environment.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
Create a story sharing system:
- **Public Share Links** - Generate secure, time-limited links to individual stories
- **Story Galleries** - Shareable collections of related stories
- **Embed Options** - Embed stories in external documentation or presentations
- **Access Controls** - Optional password protection or team-based access
- **Comments/Feedback** - Allow stakeholders to leave feedback on shared stories
- **Version History** - Track changes and iterations of shared stories

## 🎬 Use Cases
1. Product managers share layout concepts with stakeholders
2. Design teams get feedback from clients without giving system access
3. Marketing teams review component showcases
4. Remote teams collaborate on design decisions
5. Client presentations include live, interactive component examples

## 🌍 Expected Impact
- [ ] Individual developers
- [x] Design teams
- [x] Product managers
- [x] Stakeholders/clients
- [x] Enterprise teams
- [ ] Open source community

## 📝 Implementation Considerations
- Secure sharing mechanisms (time-limited tokens)
- Static generation for performance
- Mobile-responsive sharing pages
- Analytics for shared story views
- Integration with existing production deployment
```

## 🚀 Additional High-Value Features

### 4. Story Templates & Reusable Patterns

**Title:** `[FEATURE] Story templates and reusable pattern library`

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `roadmap`, `priority:medium`, `theme:developer-experience`

**Body:**
```markdown
## 🎯 Problem Description
Teams repeatedly generate similar types of layouts (dashboards, forms, landing pages) and would benefit from reusable templates and patterns to speed up their workflow.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
- **Template Library** - Curated templates for common patterns (dashboard, e-commerce, forms)
- **Custom Templates** - Save frequently used prompts as reusable templates
- **Pattern Recognition** - AI learns from existing stories to suggest patterns
- **Template Marketplace** - Share and discover community templates
- **Smart Suggestions** - Suggest relevant templates based on prompt content

## 🎬 Use Cases
1. Quickly generate dashboard layouts using proven patterns
2. Standardize component usage across team projects
3. New team members learn best practices through templates
4. Rapid prototyping with battle-tested layouts
```

### 5. Performance Insights & Optimization

**Title:** `[FEATURE] Performance insights and story optimization recommendations`

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `roadmap`, `priority:medium`, `theme:performance`

**Body:**
```markdown
## 🎯 Problem Description
Generated stories may include performance anti-patterns or inefficient component usage that developers aren't aware of.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
- **Performance Scoring** - Analyze generated stories for performance issues
- **Bundle Size Analysis** - Show impact of component choices on bundle size
- **Optimization Suggestions** - Recommend lighter alternatives or better patterns
